# Multi User Chest


## About
Allows multiple players to interact with the same chest at the same time.


## Installation
This mod requires [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) and [Jötunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/).
Extract all files to `BepInEx/plugins/MultiUserChest`

All players need to install this mod.
It can be installed at a server to enforce the installation on all clients.

Please report all errors and desyncs if they occur.
